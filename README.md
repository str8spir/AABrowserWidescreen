## ✨ Features

- 📺 **Multi-Action Floating Dock:** A horizontal 5-button dock providing instant access to the Menu, Video Crop-to-Fill, Reset (Reload + Zoom), and manual Zoom In/Out controls.
- 🎬 **Immersive Media:** Watch fullscreen DRM-protected video (supports Widevine L3 only due to technical limitations) — perfect for charging breaks or while parked.
- 🎨 **Light + AMOLED Themes:** Switch between a bright light theme and a true-black AMOLED dark mode built for car displays.
- 📺 **Crop to Fill:** Scale video content to fill ultra-wide car displays with a single tap, bypassing native fullscreen limitations while keeping browser controls accessible via the dock.
- 🌓 **Beta Dark Pages:** Optionally ask WebView to darken supported pages while the dark theme is active.
- 🏠 **Home Page Or Start Page:** Launch straight into a custom home page, or use the start page dashboard when no home page is set.
- 🚀 **Six Quick Links:** The start page now supports up to six shortcut cards with default popular sites and a custom background image.
- 🗂️ **Real Tabs + Tab Manager:** Open multiple browser tabs, switch between them from the in-app tab manager, and close tabs without losing your place.
- ♻️ **Restore Last Tabs:** Optionally reopen the full tab session from your previous launch when no home page override is active.
- 🔁 **Resume Last Page:** Optionally reopen the last visited page on launch when no home page is configured.
- 🧭 **Persistent URL Bar:** Optionally keep a compact address bar visible above the page for faster browsing.
- 🎛️ **Configurable Navigation Dock:** Choose whether the primary dock button opens the controls menu or jumps straight to the URL bar, keep the dock always visible, and move it to any corner of the screen.
- 🖼️ **Cached Site Icons:** Quick-link cards cache first-party site icons locally so the start page stays branded without refetching on every launch.
- 🔎 **Global Display Scale:** Adjust the full UI and page-content scale together with presets or a custom percentage.
- 🔄 **Smart Desktop Mode:** Seamlessly toggle between mobile and desktop rendering.
- 📚 **Dashboard Bookmarks:** Quick access to your favorite sites without touching your phone.

## 🛡️ Privacy, Reimagined
I care about the app's growth, but I care about your privacy even more. This app is designed with a **Transparency-First** policy:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **I have ZERO interest in your browsing habits.**
> - 🚫 **No URL Tracking:** I don't (and physically can't) see which websites you visit, what you search, or what you type.
> - 🕵️ **Self-Hosted Analytics:** I use a private **Umami** instance. No IP track, No Google, No Meta, no Big Tech trackers.
> - 🆔 **Anonymous Data:** I only see **"The app was opened"** and **This App Versions**. I use a random, anonymous UUID that isn't tied to your device ID or personal info.
